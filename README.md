# HR-tools
preprocessing tools and information theory measures for heart rate (HR) data

this set of files provides Python functions to read and format properly HR data, which can be:
- R-peaks time
- RR-intervals (RRI)
- HR data
either event-driven (R-peaks times) or sampled at a fixed frequency (RRI or HR).
